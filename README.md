# Anthony's GitHub Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository contains a collection of my work-related and personal projects, covering a range of languages and technologies.

## Project Overview

This repository serves as a showcase for various projects, including Python scripts, Bash utilities, and Infrastructure as Code using Terraform.

## Directory Structure

- **IaC/**
    - **Ansible/**
      - Ansible is considered another IaC tool, but I see it more as something you should
  use when the infrastructure has already been build. I really like it as a way to harden
  machines. When I first started messing around in the cloud, Ansible was the first tool
  I used to try and provision resources. Here you can find how to provision standard 
  images and more complex images.
    - **Jenkins/**
      - Just needed a place to store the default jenkins file.
      I've been using Jenkins along with Terraform to get an understanding of CI/CD.
    - **CloudFormation/**
      - CF is AWS's IaC tool, but I've been more focused on TF.
      I plan to get more of an understanding of it in the future but trying to learn both
      at the same time would be too much.
    - **Terraform/**
      - Terraform has been super fun to learn. It's cool to see infrastructure being built
        from a few lines of code. I really think having a solid understanding of some kind 
        of IaC tool goes a long way in the cloud. Here you can find some IaC projects I've
        been working. Most of them have their own readme's. Others are in separate repos,
        I did this so I can make CI/CD projects with Jenkins.
- **My Projects/**
  - Here is where you can find random projects I'm working on that aren't related
    to the majority of this repo. 
- **Python/**
  - This is where all my Python scripts and projects are. Most of the files are
    either for Harvard's 'CS50' class or the '100 Days of Code' class. those are the two
    primary resources I used to get a basic understanding of Python's syntax and
    structure.
- **Work Notes/**
  - Trying to get better at putting more info/problems/fixes in this folder as they
    come up. 
- **Work Projects/**
  - These are some scripts I've used for automating some tasks at work as well as
    trying new things.

## Installation

If you'd like to try any of these projects/scripts, make sure to install the necessary dependencies.

## Documentation

For detailed documentation on each project, refer to the respective project directories. (Although most don't have
any info) I'm trying to get better.
